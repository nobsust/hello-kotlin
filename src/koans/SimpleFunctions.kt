Simple Functions
Take a look at function syntax and make the function start return the string "OK".
In the tasks the function TODO() is used that throws an exception.
Your job during the koans will be to replace this function invocation with a meaningful code according to the problem.

fun start(): String = TODO()

 */
fun start(): String = "OK"
